# Music Genre Classification
My goal is to extract the acoustic features(librosa library is used) of each .wav file of a music dataset(GTZAN is used) before using them for training my machine learning models(KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes. scikit-learn is used); examine performance ratios after dimensionality reduction techniques(PCA,LDA,KPCA) and classifying the genre of a different music file that user has chosen. There are 10 music genres(Rock, Jazz, Classical etc.).\
